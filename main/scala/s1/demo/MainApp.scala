/**
 * [[MainApp]] extends [[JFXApp3]] which makes it a runnable ScalaFX application.
 * 
 * The app draws and plays single effects taken from the effects folder.
 * 
 * Multiple effects can be chained together (each effect ending when its [[next]] method returns true)
 * in the [[demo]] Buffer. This demo can be played by selecting "Change Effect" and "Start Demo" in the GUI.
 * 
 * Music can be added by changing the path to the audio file in [[defaultMusic]].
 * If music is not required for your effects/demo, you can simply set the volume to 0 or 
 * check the checkboxes in the GUI (when application is running).
 *
 * The variable [[stage]] in the [[start]] method declares the primary stage needed for JFXApp3.
 * In order to build your own effects and demos, 
 * you don't have to touch this variable or any of the GUI components (in the gui directory).
 * 
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * 
 * To begin building your own effects, please take a look at the example effects and 
 * the abstract class [[Effect]] that you are to extend.
 * 
 * To add your own effect to the program:
 *    - Create a new Scala file in the effects folder
 *    - This file should only contain a Scala class that extends [[Effect]]
 *    - Make sure the file's name and the class' name match! (case sensitive!)
 *    - After implementing your own [[Effect]], run [[MainApp]] (the object in this file)
 *    - You should see your own effect in the dropdown menu "Change Effect" in the GUI
 * 
 * To create a demo of chained effects:
 *    - Instantiate effects to the [[demo]] Buffer
 *    - When running [[MainApp]], select "Change Effect" and "Start Demo" from the dropdown menu
